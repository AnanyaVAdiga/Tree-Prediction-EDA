# Tree Survival Prediction-EDA


Tree seedling functional traits mediate plant-soil feedback survival responses across a gradient of light availability.

Methodology:

(the following information provided by the authors of the experiment)

We conducted a factorial blocked design field experiment, consisting of four tree species, seven soil sources (sterilized conspecific, live conspecific, and five heterospecific), and a gradient of forest understory light levels (low, medium, and high), for a total of 3,024 seedlings. We monitored seedling survival twice per week over one growing season, and we randomly selected subsets of seedlings to measure mycorrhizal colonization and phenolics, lignin, and NSC measurements at three weeks. We used Cox proportional hazards survival models to evaluate survival and linear mixed effects models to test how light availability and soil source influence traits.
